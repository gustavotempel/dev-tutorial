# DATA TYPES

The first clasification is if Data is Constant or Variable.
If data values can change during the program execution, we can name that like *Variables*. On the other hand, if data values can not change during the program execution, we can name that like *Constants*.

The next clasification is about the type of value that the data saves.

There are a lot of data types, but a good clasification for me is the following:

* Single
  * Numeric
  * Text
  * Boolean
* Multiple
  * List
  * Dictionary
